**NIGIRI**

Nigiri is a simple and light-weight Framework to make websites in PHP.

It aims at providing the minimal base that can be useful to deploy easily a website, without all the pain of setting up and learning the more advanced and complex frameworks (like Yii, Symphony, CakePHP...) when the user just needs to deploy a basic website without very advanced features.
